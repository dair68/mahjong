# Mahjong

This application features a single player version of Mahjong called Shisensho. It was made with C++ in [Qt](https://www.qt.io/). All levels generated by this application are to my knowledge winnable, so have a blast!

This application was developed in and confirmed to run in Windows 10. Download it [here](https://github.com/dair68/mahjong/releases).
